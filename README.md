The Accessible Experience
=========================

This presentation will demonstrate how various assistive technologies work and illustrate how to craft more inclusive, accessible user experiences.

## Designing for Everyone

Accessibility is not about reducing everything down to the lowest common denominator; nor is it about abandoning branding, beauty, or creativity. Itâ€™s about designing a great experience while simultaneously maximizing the number of people invited to enjoy that experience.

Takeaways from this presentation include:
* The importance of considering accessibility during the design process
* Types of disabilities found on the web, and how design decisions impact their experiences
* Specific design considerations including typography, color, and layouts
